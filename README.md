# 👋 About Me

I’m a systems engineer turned cybersecurity professional with a deep passion for defending digital environments and a track record of adapting fast to today’s evolving threat landscape. With over two decades of IT experience and a growing arsenal of security certifications and practical skills, I specialize in translating real-world challenges into actionable, secure solutions.

Currently focused on Blue Team defense and security engineering, I’m actively building my expertise in vulnerability management, threat detection, and SOC operations using tools like **Tenable**, **Microsoft Sentinel**, **Qualys**, and **Splunk**. I thrive in environments where technical curiosity, proactive mitigation, and teamwork converge.

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Focus Areas

- **Security Operations (SOC)** – Experience in triaging incidents, reviewing SIEM alerts, and contributing to threat response playbooks.  
- **Vulnerability Management** – Hands-on labs and training using Tenable, Qualys, and CVE analysis to assess and remediate system weaknesses.  
- **Cloud Security** – Learning secure configurations in Microsoft Azure and exploring threat detection with Microsoft Defender & Sentinel.  
- **Script Automation** – PowerShell and Bash scripting for scanning, system hardening, and automated alert responses.  
- **SIEM & Threat Hunting** – Creating detection rules and dashboards in Microsoft Sentinel using KQL for deep-dive investigations.  
- **Frameworks & Compliance** – Familiar with NIST CSF, CIS Controls, and PCI-DSS through coursework and applied labs.
